Teh useState hook lets you add state to functional components. 
In classes, the state is always an object. 
With the useState hook, the state doesnt have to be an object. 
The useState hook returs an array with 2 elements:
	const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)
The first element is the current value of teh state, and the second element is a state setter function. 
New state value depends on the previous state value? You can pass a function to the setter function. 
When dealing with objects or arrays, always make sure to spread ( ...name) your state variable and then call the setter function.
